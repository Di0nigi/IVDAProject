# IVDA Tutorial 

## Goal of the tutorial
The purpose of this tutorial is to build a web application template that you can later use for the group project in the second half of the semester. It also aims to familiarize you with the technologies required to develop such a web application.

## Guide
In this repo you can find the IVDA tutorial. For doing the tutorial you have a choice of technologies. You can choose between 

1. Vue Frontend + Javascript (https://vuejs.org/)
2. React Frontend + TypeScript (https://react.dev/)

You can choose between the two tutorials by switching the branch in the gitlab repo. For choosing Vue switch to the Vue branch:
