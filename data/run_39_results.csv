Thus: 1. gpt-4o-mini Scorer #1 (20) - assigns low-recognition score consistent with a niche, indexed work. 2. gpt-5-mini Scorer #1 (10) - places it at limited visibility; perhaps slightly too conservative. 3. baseline (15.0) (15) - average of models, reasonable central estimate. Own final score: 18/100 (reflects limited visibility with minor institutional presence but no evidence of substantial citations). Confidence: 75/100 (moderate confidence influenced most by gpt-4o-mini's balanced rationale and the models' general agreement)."
